Example: Construct a Cholesky Coulomb Hamiltonian from a mean-field object

This example builds a Cholesky-decomposed Coulomb Hamiltonian and returns a
`CholCoulomb` instance that provides access to the Cholesky integrals for
the following many-body solvers.

Note
--------
- Cholesky integrals in CoQu√≠ are provided mainly for **debugging and validation**.
- They are computationally **much more expensive and less scalable** than the
  THC representation, and are generally not recommended for production calculations.
- Consequently, **not all features available in THC-based electronic structure
  simulations are supported for Cholesky-based Coulomb integrals**.
