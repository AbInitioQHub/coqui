CoQui: Correlated Quantum Interface
-----------------------------------------------
**Last Updated:** Sept. 2, 2025

CoQuí, **Cor**related **Qu**antum **í**nterface, is a software project 
designed for *ab initio* electronic structure beyond density functional 
theory (DFT). Starting with a single-particle basis 
set and a mean-field solution, typically DFT or Hartree-Fock, CoQui employs 
tensor hypercontraction (THC) decomposition to efficiently process two-electron 
operators. This sophisticated approach enables CoQui to achieve exceptionally 
low-scaling algorithms in subsequent many-body calculations. 

## What does CoQui do?
CoQui utilizes distributed linear algebra to enable high-performance
*ab-initio* calculations applicable to:
- Both k-point (periodic) and molecular systems
- Generic single-particle basis sets, such as Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals,
  Gaussian-type orbitals, and their mixtures.

Currently, `CoQui` interfaces with the following backends 
(see [examples/dft_converter](examples/dft_converter) for input preparation): 
- [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org)
- [PySCF](https://pyscf.org)

Below are some key features of `CoQui`. For more detailed examples,

## Getting started with `CoQui` 
### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler that supports at least C++20.
- CMake >= 3.2.0.
- MPI Library: openmpi >= 4. 
- HDF5 >= 1.8.2 for checkpoint file I/O. 
- BLAS Library: OpenBLAS or Intel MKL. 
- LAPACK Library: OpenBLAS or Intel MKL. 
- [SLATE](https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/slate/tree/master) Library for distributed linear algebra.

### Installation
`CoQui` uses `CMake` to configure the build process. Follow 
the instructions below step-by-step, and replace the placeholders in 
square brackets (`[]`) with your local settings.

```shell
# Step 1: Clone the git repository of CoQui
git clone https://github.com/AbInitioQHub/coqui.git coqui.src

# Step 2: Create working directory for CMake to build in
mkdir -p coqui.build && cd coqui.build

# Step 3: Configure with CMake
# Replace `[YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX]` with the directory where you want CoQui installed.
# Replace `[NCORES]` with the number of cores you want to use for the test processes.
# Replace `[SLATE_INSTALL_PATH]` with your SLATE installation path. 
# Add `COQUI_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON
export slate_ROOT=[SLATE_INSTALL_PATH]
cmake \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX] \
        -DCTEST_NPROC=[NCORES] \
        -DCOQUI_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON \ # Optional: enable Python bindings
        ../coqui.src

# Step 4: Build, test and install
# Replace `[NCORES_MAKE] with the number of cores you want to use for the build processes. 
# The ctests will be executed in parallel using `[NCORES]` processors.
make -j[NCORES_MAKE] && ctest && make install

# Verify: the 'coqui' executable should be in [YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX]/bin
ls -l [YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX]/bin/coqui

# Step 5: Set CoQui environment 
# You would need to source this in every new shell, or add 
# this line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to make it persistent.
source [YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX]/share/coqui/coqui_env.sh
```
